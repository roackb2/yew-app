### What's this

This is a simple web build upon [Yew.rs](https://yew.rs/), a web framework based on Rust and WebAssembly. Yew is claimed to be reliable and efficient.

Though at the time of writing, its version is only 0.20.0 and there seems to be still a long way to go for practical production use, it's already feature rich enough to build some interesting web applications. Writing Yew is fun and the concepts are very similar to how React.js is used.

This project is my personal playground to test out how much Yew could do, and its limitation comparing to existing JS frameworks.
